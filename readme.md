# Pisces P100 → Standard LoRa Gateway Conversion

> This repository does not provide everything you need to convert your Pisces P100 to a standard SX1302 based LoRa gateway!!!
> For a hassle‑free solution, prebuilt firmware ISO packages (with all pin and configuration settings preconfigured) are also available for purchase.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This **pisces-p100-sx1302-hal** repository adapts Semtech's SX1302/SX1303 Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) library for the Pisces P100 platform. Used for testing and may not work directly on pisces p100. If you are a software developer, you can develop your own firmware based on this. If you don't want to bother, you can contact me.

Key components:

* **libloragw/**: Core HAL driver for the SX1302 concentrator chip
* **packet\_forwarder/**: Example forwarder sending uplink packets to a UDP/IP server and handling downlinks
* **mcu\_bin/**: USB–SPI bridge firmware for STM32 microcontrollers
* **util\_**\*/: Tools for reading chip IDs, bootloader utilities, and spectrum scanning
* **tools/**: Shell scripts for pin resets, power control, and gateway management

---

## 📋 Features

* **SPI or USB** connectivity modes for flexible gateway deployment
* Automated reset and power management via `tools/reset_lgw.sh`
* STM32-based DFU bootloader support for USB‑SPI bridge functionality
* Spectrum scan examples and multi‑SF demodulation support
* Easy build and deployment on Linux systems (Raspberry Pi, Ubuntu, etc.)

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

* **Hardware:** Pisces P100 device with SX1302 concentrator
* **OS:** Linux (Debian/Ubuntu/Raspbian recommended)
* **Toolchain & Utilities:**

  * GCC (native or cross‑compile for ARM: `arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc`)
  * `make`, `git`, `ssh`, `scp`
  * For USB gateway: `dfu-util` or equivalent STM32 programmer

## 🚧 Installation & Build

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mert-ozkul/pisces-p100-sx1302-hal.git
   cd pisces-p100-sx1302-hal
   ```

2. **Configure your target settings**

   * Edit `target.cfg` to match your gateway’s IP, directory, and user credentials

3. **Clean build & deploy**

   ```bash
   make clean all
   make install         # Deploy binaries via SSH to your gateway device
   make install_conf    # Copy packet_forwarder JSON configs
   ```

4. **Optional: Cross‑compile for ARM**

   ```bash
   export ARCH=arm
   export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
   make clean all
   ```

## ▶️ Usage

### Packet Forwarder

Run the forwarder with your configuration:

```bash
./bin/packet_forwarder --config global_conf.json
```

* **Uplink:** RF → LoRa concentrator → UDP server
* **Downlink:** UDP server → LoRa concentrator → RF

### USB Gateway Mode

Activate USB–SPI bridge on `/dev/ttyACM0`:

```bash
./util_boot/boot.sh -u -d /dev/ttyACM0
```

This script enters DFU mode on the STM32 and bridges USB to the SX1302 via SPI.
